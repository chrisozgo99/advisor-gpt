        "info": "In addition to required courses for the computer engineering degree, the program offers the ability to customize studies with a variety of electives. Elective courses for the major are grouped into thematic areas. Students can choose to pursue one of these threads or pick electives that span multiple areas. The bachelor's degree in computer engineering consists of the three computer engineering foundation threads (Distributed Systems & Software Design, Cybersecurity, Computing Hardware & Emerging Architectures); three Computer Science threads (Devices, Information Internetworks, Systems & Architecture); and three electrical engineering threads (Robotics & Autonomous Systems, Telecommunications, Signal & Information Processing) shown below. Students satisfy degree requirements by selecting two of the threads listed below with at least one thread being chosen from one of the three computer engineering foundation threads. For example, students may select threads in one of the following ways: 1) Two computer engineering foundation threads, 2) One computer engineering foundation thread / one computer science thread (NOTE: ECE2020 and ECE2035 substitute for CS2110; ECE3058 substitutes for CS2200), 3) One computer engineering foundation thread  / one electrical engineering thread (NOTE: Requires taking ECE2026)",

                "description": "The Georgia Tech Undergraduate Cooperative Education Program allows students to combine classroom study with paid practical work experience directly related to the academic major. Co-ops alternate semesters of on-campus study with semesters of full-time employment, normally beginning the program as freshmen or sophomores. Over 30 percent of ECE undergraduates participate in the co-op program. The degree requirements for students in the co-op program are the same as those for other students in the major. The Cooperative Plan designation may be pursued separately or in combination with the International Plan and/or the Research Option. Begun in 1912, Georgia Tech's program is currently the largest optional co-op program in the United States and has perennially been listed in U.S. News & World Report as one of the top ten co-op programs in America. As an integral part of the overall education experience, the co-op program allows students to take on increasing levels of responsibility and to use their job knowledge and classroom learning to make meaningful contributions to the organizations in which they work. Many co-op graduates are hired by their co-op employer, and more than 700 companies or government organizations throughout the United States and abroad currently employ Georgia Tech Undergrad Co-op Program students. Because the School of ECE in Atlanta offers a wide range of electives and almost all required courses every term, including summer, co-op students have substantial flexibility in completing their degree requirements. Many students continue their co-op work assignments through the senior year. Additionally, co-op students working in the Atlanta area may be able to take certain ECE courses, particularly laboratories offered in the evening, during the work term. In addition to the co-op program, the Center for Career Discovery and Development also offers the Undergraduate Professional Internship and Work Abroad programs. These programs also provide opportunities for students to gain practical work experience, without the long-term commitment of the co-op program."

The International Plan develops global competence through a combination of coursework, language study, and residential overseas experience. Students who complete this option receive a designation on their transcript and diploma. The computer engineering aspects of the BS CmpE - International Plan degree requirements are identical to those for the regular BS CmpE . Please refer to the BS CmpE catalog description for general information about the degree program. Students may be able to satisfy the additional requirements imposed for the International Plan designation through appropriate choices of electives without additional credit hours to complete the degree. The International Plan designation may be pursued separately, or in combination with the Cooperative Plan and/or the Research Option. The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers a junior-year program at the Georgia Tech-Europe campus in Metz, France, that is designed to facilitate participation in the International Plan. However, computer engineering majors are not restricted to this option and may complete any allowable courses, languages, and overseas experiences that satisfy the International Plan requirements."

This thread explores how software systems are created to do this—from controlling small scale embedded microarchitectures to large-scale data centers, and from tracking personal fitness to coordinating distributed technology in smart cities. For instance, how do we orchestrate a massive array of computers to accelerate the search for new pharmaceuticals or immunotherapies? How can we share knowledge with each other and collaborate through cloud services while maintaining consistency, accessibility, and security? How does a network of smart cameras seamlessly track an Olympic ice skater or skier during a fast-paced event? How do we coordinate geographically dispersed, interconnected devices in smart cities, farms, and forests, that balance computing locally ('on the edge') with leveraging shared information globally ('in the cloud') to achieve performance and energy efficiency?

Signal and information processing is at the heart of our modern world, powering today’s entertainment and tomorrow’s technology. It’s at the intersection of biotechnology and social interactions. It enhances our ability to communicate and share information, between humans, between humans and machines, or between machines. Signal and information processing is behind every aspect of our digital lives.Over the past six decades, the types of signals and the functionalities on which this branch of science has focused have broadened to include radar signals, geophysical signals, audio, speech, music, images, videos, 3D graphics, social network data, biomedical data, bio signals, and more. Sensors feed data into a signal and information processing module that interprets the captured data and enables visualization, analysis, manipulation, and control for the SIP engineer. The discipline includes several applications of math and principles of electrical engineering to represent signals and information in ways that are beneficial for the application at hand. In today’s applications, you will find SIP in your mobile phone representing your images and videos via compression and analytics, in autonomous vehicles providing an understanding of the surrounding environment for safe and effective driving experience by machines, in healthcare establishments imaging our bodies and brains, in energy companies, and in every social media platform. Signal and information processing is the core of today’s artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, previously known as pattern recognition. Have you shared \"what’s on your mind” with social media friends or video chatted with family today? These are just two of the many ways we use machine learning every day. Machine learning and SIP bring together mathematics, computer science, and statistics to harness predictive power, and provide the technology behind other applications, including detecting credit card fraud, medical diagnostics, stock market analysis, speech recognition, and video understanding.

Co-ops alternate semesters of on-campus study with semesters of full-time employment, normally beginning the program as freshmen or sophomores. Over 30 percent of ECE undergraduates participate in the co-op program. The degree requirements for students in the co-op program are the same as those for other students in the major. The Cooperative Plan designation may be pursued separately or in combination with the International Plan and/or the Research Option. Begun in 1912, Georgia Tech's program is currently the largest optional co-op program in the United States and has perennially been listed in U.S. News & World Report as one of the top ten co-op programs in America. As an integral part of the overall education experience, the co-op program allows students to take on increasing levels of responsibility and to use their job knowledge and classroom learning to make meaningful contributions to the organizations in which they work. Many co-op graduates are hired by their co-op employer, and more than 700 companies or government organizations throughout the United States and abroad currently employ Georgia Tech Undergrad Co-op Program students. Because the School of ECE in Atlanta offers a wide range of electives and almost all required courses every term, including summer, co-op students have substantial flexibility in completing their degree requirements. Many students continue their co-op work assignments through the senior year. Additionally, co-op students working in the Atlanta area may be able to take certain ECE courses, particularly laboratories offered in the evening, during the work term. In addition to the co-op program, the Center for Career Discovery and Development also offers the Undergraduate Professional Internship and Work Abroad programs. These programs also provide opportunities for students to gain practical work experience, without the long-term commitment of the co-op program."

Thus, devices are the smallest and most fundamental element of this hierarchy. Device design is the most basic element and skill needed in the optoelectronics/electronics industry and as the devices most often limit performance such as speed, power efficiency, or behavior, knowledge of device design and manufacture is critically sought by industry. Systems are analogous to the human body. The circuits are analogous to the heart and the devices analogous to the heart muscle cells, i.e. the core building block of the entire system/body. But unlike the human body, we have control of the design of the device allowing it to be made faster, more power efficient, or even the ability to create new devices with new behaviors. The Electronic & Optical Devices thread prepares you for a career designing and manufacturing nano-scale devices that for example, are used in complex circuitry to perform some desired function such as computation, sensing, control, communications, and amplification, among countless other functions.Unlike other threads that focus exclusively on one functionality using pre-made device “components” outside your control, this thread provides detailed understanding of device operational principles, design methods, and methods and limitations in manufacturing these devices that allow you to understand how to make new or improve on existing devices.
